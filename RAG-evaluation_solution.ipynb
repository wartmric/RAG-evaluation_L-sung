    "In this task, you will combine all the steps from the previous tasks to create a reusable function for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The function will process raw text documents, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector store for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function:**\n",
    "   - Create a function named `build_rag_model` with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`texts` (List[str]):** A list of raw documents or text strings to process.\n",
    "     - **`embedding_model` (str):** The name of the Hugging Face embedding model to use.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_size` (int):** The maximum size of each text chunk.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_overlap` (int):** The overlap size between consecutive chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the Steps:**\n",
    "   - **Step 1:** **Split Text into Chunks**\n",
    "     - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the provided `texts` into chunks.\n",
    "     - Ensure the function handles all documents in the list and combines the resulting chunks.\n",
    "     - Print the number of generated chunks for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** **Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "     - Initialize a `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` object using the provided `embedding_model`.\n",
    "     - Use this object to generate embeddings for the text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** **Create a Vector Store**\n",
    "     - Use `Chroma.from_texts` to create a vector store from the chunks and their embeddings.\n",
    "     - Print the number of chunks stored in the vector store for confirmation.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task, you will define and initialize a generative model that can answer user questions based on a given context. This involves creating a prompt template, setting up an output parser, and initializing the language model for generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Use the `PromptTemplate` class to define a template that specifies how user questions and the associated context are structured.\n",
    "   - Your template should:\n",
    "     - Include placeholders for the context (`{context}`) and question (`{question}`).\n",
    "     - Provide clear instructions for the model to generate answers based only on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Set the `template` argument to the system template:\n",
    "   - Specify the `input_variables` as `[\"context\", \"question\"]` to define the placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Output Parser:**\n",
    "   - Use the `StrOutputParser` to parse the string output from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initialize the Generative Model:**\n",
    "   - Use the `ChatGroq` class to set up a generative model with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`model`:** Specify the model name (e.g., `\"llama-3.2-3b-preview\"`).\n",
    "     - **`temperature`:** Set to `0` for deterministic outputs.\n",
    "     - **`max_tokens`:** Set to `None` to allow the model to decide the output length.\n",
    "     - **`timeout`:** Set to handle timeouts during generation.\n",
    "     - **`max_retries`:** Define the number of retries in case of failure.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task, you will create a function that leverages the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to answer user questions. The function will retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge index and use the RAG chain to generate a response.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function:**\n",
    "   - Name the function `answer_with_rag`.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** Prepare the Input for the RAG Chain\n",
    "     - Create a dictionary named `rag_input` with the following keys:\n",

    "       - **`question`:** The user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** Generate an Answer\n",
    "     - Pass the `rag_input` to the `rag_chain` using the `invoke` method.\n",
    "     - Store the generated response in the variable `answer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Results:**\n",
    "   - The function should return a tuple containing:\n",

    "### Critique QA Pairs Using LLM Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will evaluate each generated QA pair using the previously defined critique prompts for **groundedness**, **relevance**, and **stand-alone clarity**. The goal is to score and document the quality of each question based on the provided context and criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Code Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate Over QA Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Loops through the `outputs` list, which contains the generated QA pairs (`context`, `question`, `answer`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Evaluations:**\n",
    "   - For each QA pair:\n",
    "     - **Groundedness:** Uses the `question_groundedness_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is answerable based on the given context.\n",
    "     - **Relevance:** Uses the `question_relevance_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is useful for the intended audience.\n",
    "     - **Stand-alone Clarity:** Uses the `question_standalone_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is understandable without additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Call the LLM for Each Criterion:**\n",
    "   - Sends the formatted prompt for each criterion to the LLM using `call_llm`.\n",
    "   - Stores the response in the `evaluations` dictionary under the respective criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parse the Results:**\n",
    "   - Extracts the **`Total rating`** (score) and **`Evaluation`** (text rationale) from the LLM's response.\n",
    "   - Updates the `output` dictionary with the scores and evaluations for each criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**\n",
    "   - If any part of the process fails (e.g., LLM output is malformed), the loop skips the current QA pair and continues with the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update Outputs:**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert QA Pairs to a DataFrame:**\n",

    "     - Converts the `outputs` list (which now includes QA pairs and their scores) into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Display the Evaluation Dataset (Before Filtering):**\n",
    "   - Prints a subset of columns:\n",
    "     - **`question`:** The generated question.\n",
    "     - **`answer`:** The corresponding answer.\n",
    "     - **`groundedness_score`, `relevance_score`, `standalone_score`:** Scores assigned during the critique step.\n",
    "   - This provides an overview of the dataset before applying any filtering criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filter the QA Pairs:**\n",
    "   - Keeps only QA pairs that meet the following conditions:\n",
    "     - **`groundedness_score` >= 4:** The question is well-anchored in the provided context.\n",
    "     - **`standalone_score` >= 4:** The question is clear and understandable without additional context.\n",
    "   - **Note:** The `relevance_score` is not used for filtering here, but it remains part of the dataset for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display the Filtered Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Prints the filtered DataFrame to show the high-quality QA pairs that passed the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Convert to a Hugging Face Dataset:**\n",
    "   - `eval_dataset = datasets.Dataset.from_pandas(generated_questions, split=\"train\", preserve_index=False)`:\n",
    "     - Converts the filtered pandas DataFrame into a Hugging Face `Dataset` object, which is commonly used for training and evaluation in NLP tasks.\n",
    "     - The `split=\"train\"` argument designates this as a training split.\n",
    "     - `preserve_index=False` ensures the index from the pandas DataFrame is not carried over to the `Dataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of This Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Refinement:**\n",
    "   - Filters out low-quality QA pairs to ensure only well-scored questions and answers are included in the final dataset.\n",
    "   - Focuses on groundedness and stand-alone clarity to improve the overall utility and reliability of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Final Dataset Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Converts the data into a format suitable for further evaluation or training machine learning models, such as Hugging Face models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality Assurance:**\n",
    "   - Provides a visual overview of the dataset before and after filtering, allowing for manual inspection of the data quality."

    "### Explanation: Evaluating Generated Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This function evaluates the quality of answers generated by the RAG system using a predefined evaluation prompt and a scoring language model. The evaluation process is iterative and updates the results file in place for checkpointing and saving progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Function Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Evaluation Environment:**\n",
    "   - **`answer_path`:** Path to the JSON file containing the generated answers.\n",
    "   - **`eval_chat_model`:** The language model used for evaluation (e.g., GPT-4).\n",
    "   - **`evaluator_name`:** A string identifier for the evaluator (e.g., \"GPT4\").\n",
    "   - **`evaluation_prompt_template`:** The prompt template that defines how the evaluation task is framed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load Existing Results:**\n",
    "   - If the `answer_path` file exists, loads the previously saved results into `answers`.\n",
    "   - This ensures that previously evaluated answers are not re-evaluated, saving time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Generated Answers:**\n",
    "   - For each entry in `answers`:\n",
    "     - **Check for Prior Evaluation:** If the answer has already been evaluated by the specified evaluator (`eval_score_{evaluator_name}`), skip it.\n",
    "     - **Prepare the Evaluation Prompt:**\n",
    "       - Uses `evaluation_prompt_template` to format the instruction, response, and reference answer into the structured prompt.\n",
    "     - **Evaluate the Response:**\n",
    "       - Sends the prompt to the `eval_chat_model` (e.g., GPT-4) and receives the evaluation result.\n",
    "     - **Parse the Result:**\n",
    "       - Extracts `feedback` and `score` from the model's output, splitting on `[RESULT]` to ensure the expected format is followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the Results:**\n",
    "   - Adds the following fields to the current experiment:\n",
    "     - **`eval_score_{evaluator_name}`:** The numeric score assigned by the evaluator.\n",
    "     - **`eval_feedback_{evaluator_name}`:** The detailed feedback provided by the evaluator.\n",
    "   - Saves the updated `answers` list back to the `answer_path` file after each iteration for checkpointing.\n",

    "### Explanation: Running the Complete RAG Evaluation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This script integrates all the steps covered so far to run a full evaluation of the RAG system across different configurations. It includes embedding creation, chunking, retrieval, generation, and evaluation in a loop to test multiple setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Output Directory:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that a directory named `./output` exists to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Configurations:**\n",
    "   - **`embedding_models`:** List of embedding models to test (e.g., `\"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"`).\n",
    "   - **`chunk_sizes`:** List of `(chunk_size, overlap)` tuples to test different chunking strategies.\n",
    "     - Example:\n",
    "       - `[2000, 100]`: Chunks of 2000 characters with 100-character overlap.\n",
    "       - `[5000, 500]`: Larger chunks of 5000 characters with 500-character overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Configurations:**\n",
    "   - Loops through all combinations of `embedding_models` and `chunk_sizes`.\n",
    "   - Constructs a unique `settings_name` for each combination to name the output files clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build the Knowledge Base:**\n",
    "   - Calls the `build_rag_model` function with:\n",
    "     - `texts`: The input data (e.g., pre-split chunks of the documents).\n",
    "     - `embedding_model`: The current embedding model.\n",
    "     - `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`: Parameters for splitting the text.\n",
    "   - Converts the resulting vector store into a retriever (`knowledge_index`) for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the RAG System:**\n",
    "   - Iterates through the `eval_dataset` (assumed to contain questions and true answers).\n",
    "   - Calls the `answer_with_rag` function to:\n",
    "     - Retrieve relevant documents using the `knowledge_index`.\n",
    "     - Generate answers using the RAG chain (`rag_chain`).\n",
    "   - Appends the results to a list, including:\n",
    "     - The question, true answer, generated answer, and retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save Results:**\n",
    "   - Saves the answers to a JSON file named based on the configuration (`output_file_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate the Answers:**\n",
    "   - Calls `evaluate_answers` to:\n",
    "     - Critique and score the generated answers using the LLM evaluator (`eval_chat_model`).\n",
    "     - Update the saved results with scores and feedback for each answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible Testing:**\n",
    "   - Tests multiple configurations for embeddings and chunking, enabling comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results Storage:**\n",
    "   - Saves intermediate and final results to disk for reproducibility and further analysis.\n",
